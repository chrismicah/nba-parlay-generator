### 🧮 **Bayesian Methodology**

#### **1. Prior Distribution Management**
```python
evidence_priors = {
    "roberta_confidence": 0.5,  # Neutral prior for RoBERTa
    "rag_quality": 0.6,         # Slightly positive prior for RAG
    "odds_movement": 0.5,       # Neutral prior for odds
    "injury_intel": 0.7,        # Positive prior for injury info
    "sharp_money": 0.8,         # Strong prior for sharp money
    "public_betting": 0.4       # Negative prior for public betting
}
```

#### **2. Likelihood Calculation**
- **Formula**: P(Evidence|Hypothesis) using logistic transformation
- **Reliability Weighting**: Evidence adjusted by source reliability
- **Transformation**: `likelihood = 1 / (1 + exp(-5 * (adjusted_confidence - 0.5)))`

#### **3. Bayesian Update Process**
- **Sequential Updates**: Each evidence source updates the posterior
- **Formula**: `P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)`
- **Marginal Likelihood**: Uses law of total probability
- **Evidence Weighting**: Weighted interpolation for evidence importance

### 📊 **Evidence Source Integration**

#### **1. RoBERTa Confidence (JIRA-019)**
- **Source**: `tools/parlay_confidence_predictor.py`
- **Input**: Reasoning text from parlay analysis
- **Output**: Confidence score, prediction certainty, probabilities
- **Reliability**: 85% base reliability, scaled by prediction certainty

#### **2. RAG Retrieval Quality**
- **Metrics**: Relevance scores, source diversity, coverage
- **Quality Score**: `(avg_relevance * 0.6) + (max_relevance * 0.3) + (coverage * 0.1)`
- **Source Boost**: Higher quality sources get better weighting
- **Reliability**: Scaled by source diversity (multiple sources = higher reliability)

#### **3. Real-Time Odds Movement**
- **Analysis**: Movement patterns, consistency, strength
- **Calculation**: Average movement × movement consistency
- **Confidence**: `0.5 + (movement_strength * sensitivity)`
- **Reliability**: 90% (market data highly reliable)

#### **4. Contextual Evidence Extraction**
- **Injury Intelligence**: Detects injury mentions, weights by frequency
- **Sharp Money Signals**: Identifies professional betting patterns
- **Public Betting**: Contrarian indicator (high public = lower confidence)
- **Keyword Analysis**: Pattern matching with confidence scoring

### 🎮 **Volatility & Context Adjustments**

#### **Game Type Modifiers**
- **Playoffs**: +5% confidence boost (higher reliability)
- **Preseason**: -8% confidence penalty (lower reliability)
- **Back-to-Back**: -3% confidence penalty (fatigue factor)
- **National TV**: +2% confidence boost (more scrutiny)

#### **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**
- **Base Threshold**: 0.6 (60% confidence required)
- **Evidence Quality Adjustment**: ±5% based on average reliability
- **Game Context Adjustment**: Preseason +5%, Playoffs -3%
- **Bounds**: Minimum 30%, Maximum 80%

### 🔬 **Testing & Validation**

#### **Test Coverage**: `tests/test_jira_020a_bayesian_confidence.py`
- **19 Test Cases**: All passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Evidence extraction, Bayesian calculations, threshold logic
- **Integration Tests**: Complete workflow with realistic scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: No evidence, conflicting signals, extreme values

#### **Demo Scenarios**: `tools/bayesian_demo_standalone.py`
1. **High Confidence**: Strong evidence across all sources → PROCEED
2. **Summer League**: Low confidence + volatility penalty → FLAG
3. **Mixed Evidence**: Conflicting signals → Moderate confidence
4. **Playoff Game**: High stakes + reliability boost → PROCEED

### 📈 **Performance Results**

#### **Scenario Analysis Results**
```
Scenario        Confidence  Should Flag  Threshold   Status
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High Confidence    1.000       False       0.600    PROCEED
Low Confidence     0.000       True        0.600    FLAG
Mixed Evidence     0.908       False       0.600    PROCEED
Playoff Game       1.000       False       0.520    PROCEED
```
