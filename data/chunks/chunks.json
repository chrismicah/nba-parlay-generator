Thus, the major league equivalent of an AAA minor\nleague OBP would be roughly 0.89 times the minor league OBP. We\nwould therefore predict that Joe would achieve a \u201cmajor league equivalent\u201d\nOBP of .89 /H11003(.360) /H11005.320 in the major leagues.",

One reason that NFL payrolls seem to\nhave a larger in\ufb02uence on team per for mance than do NBA payrolls is the\nfact that in the NFL no player\u2019s salary is guaranteed. You may cut an NFL\nplayer and the team does not have to pay him. This means that if an NFL\nteam signs an expensive free agent and he does not pan out, the team can\nget his salary off the payroll. In contrast, most NBA contracts are struc-\ntured such that an NBA team must pay a player even if they cut the player.",

In every conversation I\u2019ve had about the weakened Eastern\nConference, they\u2019re never mentioned without an eye roll or shoulder shrug. I\nfully understand this sentiment and agree with it, coming off a calamitous\n24-win season that didn\u2019t entirely feel like a fluke. But on the other hand,\ngroupthink is treacherous terrain. It isn\u2019t _that_ hard to look around, assess\nthe landscape, and construct a pro-Sixers case for the 2025-26 season.",

This NBA offseason made that\nmuch clear, as teams adapt to life under the league\u2019s dual aprons. There\u2019s no\nlonger any real cap space to be found, and thus no real market for free agents\neither. The biggest outright signing for a player joining a new team this\nsummer came in the form of [Myles Turner\u2019s four-year, $107 million stunner\nwith the Bucks.](https://www.theringer.com/2025/07/01/nba/milwaukee-bucks-\ndamian-lillard-waived-myles-turner-signing-giannis-antetokounmpo) In order to\neven make that possible, Milwaukee stretched and waived the contract of a\nfuture Hall of Famer and ate $113 million in the process.",

Mitchell was a revelation for the\nThunder on a two-way last season, to the point that OKC converted him to a\nstandard contract back in February. Then the Thunder declined a team option to\ntriple down on Mitchell with a three-year agreement for less than $9 million\u2014a\npaltry sum for a guard with this much juice.",

That could be a big deal for a\nThunder team that\u2019s about to get dramatically more expensive, and may need a\ncost-controlled player like Mitchell to step into a bigger role over time.\nIt\u2019s a good bet that he\u2019ll be ready for it after a bit more time in one of the\nbest development systems in basketball.End of article",

He won\nan MVP award, has two scoring titles, led the league in assists three times,\nmade nine All-Star teams, and single-handedly normalized the triple-double.\nBut all that glamorous cigar smoke is now a cold pile of ash. Westbrook is\nsearching for his seventh team in seven years. The most probable scenario here\nis that he\u2019ll go home, stay in shape, and wait for some team\u2019s backup point\nguard to get injured. It\u2019d be a sobering, sputtering end to one of the more\nelectrifying individual careers in NBA history. But if he can\u2019t make it work\nwith Jokic, it\u2019s hard to envision another team talking itself into giving him\nanother chance.",

For all his health\nstruggles in Miami to come, Shaq nailed his shot at revenge during his first\nseason with the Heat, finishing as the MVP runner-up. Given how intent Luka\nand his representation are on publicizing this transformation across numerous\nmedia, Doncic has already secured a flawless victory. How that translates to\nthe season is still in question. For all of the added attention this time\naround, Luka hasn\u2019t really shown us anything we hadn\u2019t already seen from him\nbefore. Will the rigors of the season fell him, as they have in the past, or\nhas he built up the necessary resistance over these past three months? Not",

The Lakers went\nout of their way to show their trust in their newfound star; Doncic, in turn,\nrewarded them with a commitment\u2014both in conditioning and on paper\u2014that the\nMavericks desperately wanted but ultimately denied themselves.",

My reaction was:\nIf he was not willing to get in shape\u2014which he had five, eight years, some\nnumber of times to do, and we urged him\u2014it seems that the motivation for him\nto lose weight was to trade him,\u201d Buss told reporters. \u201cAs you know, Shaq is\nin his middle-30s and it might be difficult to build around him.

The rise of many international stars has\nhelped grow the game around the globe, as well as with thousands of immigrants\nthat now live in the states.\n\nNot every wager is the same amount, however, and NBA bettors who pay attention\nto The Action Network's public betting data can spot sharp bets.\n\n## How to Use Public Betting and Money Percentages in NBA Betting",

For example, if we track a total handle -- a betting term that means \"amount wagered\" -- of $6 million and $5 million is on the [Lakers](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/odds/los-angeles-lakers), that would be 83% of the money on the Lakers.",

And even within a\nstatistical model, NBA handicappers can vary in how they approach building it,\nfocusing on team performance, player performance, or perhaps a hybrid blend of\nboth.\n\nAt The Action Network, our NBA projections are projection blends of several of\nour key betting experts. How they approach their final numbers on a game might\nvary, but the blend of those projections work to create a better, composite\nnumber that is our best reflection of what to expect in a game.",

    "content": "We project the three big markets in NBA betting -- spreads, over/unders, and\nmoneylines -- and do so for every game in each season. Within our PRO Report\n-- part of our PRO subscription -- we'll measure those projections against\nlines for every U.S. book, so you can easily spot edges and potential bets.\n\nA lot of our experts rely on advanced statistics to build their models and get\ntheir numbers on games, and of course it's incredibly important when building\nNBA projections to be aware of news and injuries.",

    "content": "It's not unreasonable to see a line move 6-7 points or more if a star is\nsuddenly ruled out ahead of a game. Using advanced stats, along with a variety\nof other important factors like recent play, advantages for a team on offense\nand defense, player values, news, predicting home-court advantage and rest\nsituations is how our experts land on the numbers you see above.\n\n## **The Action Network's NBA Projections**\n\nOur NBA experts will provide consensus projections for every NBA game's\nspread, moneyline, and over/under. On this page you'll then find those\nprojections compared to the market in two ways: 1) the edge, which is the\npercentage difference between a sportsbook's odds vs. our projections and 2) a\nletter grade based on that edge.",

But if you just want to quickly eye things, the \"A\" through \"F\" grades\nare based on those edge numbers and might be easier to understand for novice\nbettors. Both comparisons are color-coded with the highest edges and \"A\"\ngrades given a green coloring while negative edges and \"F\" grades will have\nred markings.",

Say the [Los Angeles\nLakers](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/odds/los-angeles-lakers) have a\nspread of -6.5 vs. the [Sacramento\nKings](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/odds/sacramento-kings). In that\nsituation, a spread bet on the Lakers would cash if they won by a 7 points or\nmore.

Say the [Orlando\nMagic](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/teams/orlando-magic) are +250 on the\nmoneyline vs. the [Chicago\nBulls](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/teams/chicago-bulls), who are -290.\nIf you bet $10 on the Magic and they won, you would receive $25 in profit.

Just a few here and there. Of the \nthree ways, the supernerds play the smallest role in the process.",

The long \nterm is always longer than you think it is. 228  THE LOGIC OF SPORTS BETTING   \nThus, the question. How do I know if I\u2019m winning? \nFirst, you have to start betting. There\u2019s no such thing as \n\ufb01guring out if you\u2019re going to win without getting your beak wet. \nSports betting is a multiplayer game, and if you\u2019re not betting, \nyou\u2019re not playing.

Record what you bet, how much \nyou bet, the result of the bet. \nStep three is to do it for a while until you get a nice record of \nsettled bets. Are you winning or not? At some point this record \nbegins to speak for itself. If you\u2019re ahead after, say, a thousand \nbets, that\u2019s a good sign. \nBut even then, record is not de\ufb01nitive.
