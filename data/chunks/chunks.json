Using the\navailable data for the INT, we learn that batters had an OBP that averaged\n90% of their last minor league OBP during their \ufb01rst year in the majors af-\nter their last year (or part of year) in the INT. Batters who had played in\nthe PCL averaged 88% of their last minor league OBP during their \ufb01rst\nyear in the majors. Thus, the major league equivalent of an AAA minor\nleague OBP would be roughly 0.89 times the minor league OBP. We\nwould therefore predict that Joe would achieve a \u201cmajor league equivalent\u201d\nOBP of .89 /H11003(.360) /H11005.320 in the major leagues.",

Garnett has a defense rating of /H1100212 points.\nWhile a positive offense rating is good, a negative defense rating is good.\nThus when Garnett replaces an average NBA defensive player, he causes\nthe team to give up 12 fewer points. A good defensive rating can be cre-\nated by doing many things: blocking shots, stopping the pick and roll,\n reducing turnovers, causing turnovers, rebounding, and so forth.

One reason that NFL payrolls seem to\nhave a larger in\ufb02uence on team per for mance than do NBA payrolls is the\nfact that in the NFL no player\u2019s salary is guaranteed. You may cut an NFL\nplayer and the team does not have to pay him. This means that if an NFL\nteam signs an expensive free agent and he does not pan out, the team can\nget his salary off the payroll. In contrast, most NBA contracts are struc-\ntured such that an NBA team must pay a player even if they cut the player.",
