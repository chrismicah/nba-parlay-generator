Sell High
1) Jameson Williams - Expect more consistent involvement from Amon-Ra St. Brown & Sam LaPorta than we've seen through 2 weeks. Williams has enough buzz to pull a top-15 ROS WR in return.

2) Sam LaPorta - Injured in camp so likely ramping up to full strength. Has the most routes ran of any TE in the league & his 10% targets-per-route-ran rate is a huge drop from his 24% rate last year, which will certainly return to normal.

3) Chris Olave - We likely aren‚Äôt going to continue to see 4 TD games for Alvin Kamara & eventually Olave will outproduce Rashid Shaheed. So far their new offensive scheme & playcaller have lead to the best offense in football through two weeks.

Let's break it all down üëá

https://t.co/V4LrZNm83C",https://x.com/FantasyLabsNFL/status/1823865269166727240,,,3,6676

By waiting to draft your RB2 and beyond, you can scoop up potential league-winners at a fraction of the cost (ex: Jerome Ford).
