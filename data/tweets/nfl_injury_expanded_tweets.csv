Like any move, it comes with risk. They don‚Äôt all work out (eg Carson Wentz). 

But it is clear the early paydays for stars have so many benefits, including this reality: rewarding players early results in goodwill between the team and player. Philly paid Land Johnson immediately when he became eligible and the partnership has thrived for over a decade. 

When early deals start to move down the totem pole or a player outperforms his remaining deal (like Lane or Saquon), that goodwill goes a long way in making deal corrections easier to execute.
