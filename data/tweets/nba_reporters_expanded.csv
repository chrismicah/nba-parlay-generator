---
I want to thank the entire Real Madrid club for their love and treatment during these eight years and, no less important, teaching me how to play basketball and training me with values. 

This stage closes today and I am very proud to have fulfilled a dream: to compete with the best players in Europe in the best club in the world. Something that that little eleven-year-old boy has not yet assumed, but that he will never be able to repay this club for everything it did for him.

Anyone who knows me knows that I have dedicated my entire life to Real Madrid. I have become the player I am today largely because of this club and wherever I go there will always be another Real Madrid player. I have been since I was a child and turned on the television to see my idols win big titles, without imagining that I would be part of this legendary legacy.

I don't want to forget all the people who have helped me throughout my career: coaches, physiotherapists, delegates, physical trainers, props, press, doctors, etc. Those people who often work in the shadows and do not get the recognition they deserve. Of course, to President Florentino Pérez, Juan Carlos Sánchez, Alberto Herreros, Alberto Angulo and Pablo Sañudo, who trusted me from day one.

Of course, I want to thank our fans for cheering me on and defending me in every game, playing for the best club on the planet.

Finally, I want to tell you that our paths will cross again, of that I am sure. Meanwhile, from a distance, I will support the team as much or more than I do as a player. I love Real Madrid and I couldn't be more grateful for everything they have given me.

See you soon and good luck,

Hala Madrid!

Hugo.",https://x.com/Marc_DAmico/status/1939713433689280904,,2,1,9694
