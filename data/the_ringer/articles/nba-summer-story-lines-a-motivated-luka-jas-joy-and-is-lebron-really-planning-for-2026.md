## About the episode

Verno and Jacoby discuss the new-look Luka Doncic who was featured in the
latest edition of _Men’s Health_ magazine. They debate what kind of impact a
healthier Luka will make on the Lakers, the topics not discussed in the
article, and his surprise appearance at a Yankees game. Next, they take a deep
dive on Nikola Jokic’s agent’s cryptic photo with LeBron James and Maverick
Carter, Verno explains why he expects a big bounce-back season from Ja Morant,
and they debate where the remaining restricted free agents could possibly
land. After, they discuss Billy Donovan’s contract extension with the Bulls
and the anonymous Nets executive who says that Michael Porter Jr. could lead
the league in scoring next season, and Verno shares his experience staying at
Jacoby’s apartment when he visited New York.
