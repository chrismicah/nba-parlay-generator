# Let Nikola Jokic Enjoy His Side Quest

A horse won. A man cried. Then we all kind of ruined it.

 _“A man that don’t love a horse, there is something the matter with him.”
—Will Rogers_

Maybe you have seen the video. A harness race at Duzijanac in Subotica,
Serbia. Three-time NBA MVP and proud pony boy Nikola Jokic is standing
trackside with his head in his hands. Big Honey is overwhelmed by victory and
melting into a puddle, with these great big cartoon tears spraying off his
face after some new nirvana has been found. His horse, Demon Dell’Est, won.
And Jokic is bursting.

Joker hops the fence and walks onto the track wearing a smile and a shirt that
looks like it’s from UNTUCKit’s Belgrade location, what I imagine to be a
small brick-and-mortar along the banks of the Danube. In my mind, the store is
flanked by Bratislav’s Rakija Bazaar and a cheese shop named Najsirastiji. The
cheese shop’s proprietor is an ancient side of beef who wears yellow
tracksuits and makes everyone call him Ujak. Try the _sen nekter_. Sturdy
little _sir_ made of milk from cows that feast on the volcanic pasturelands of
Auvergne, France. It’s gotta be the magma.

The Sombor Shuffler basks in the glory of his victory. He embraces the driver.
He pats his horse. Watching Jokic pat his horse is to watch a holy act of
devotion from a man obsessed, a man in love. Watching Jokic hug anyone of the
diminutive driver’s size is like watching a father hug their toddler. He could
put the guy in his pocket.

Cut to Yoke in the winner’s circle,
[Stala](https://x.com/ljubomirovicm/status/1529054466082742272?s=46&t=ja7TXFYUiFAOBQgFcAmRuw)
Dream [Catcher](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/serbian-nba-
basketball-player-nikola-jokic-of-the-denver-news-photo/1258790454) in the no.
1 spot. You wanna talk about stoked? You wanna talk about a man in paradise?
He pops a bottle, dumps the bubbly on his team, himself. His shirt is wet with
Champagne and sweat. His cheeks are wet with tears. A pink face in ecstasy.

Jokic [loves
horses](https://x.com/nba_philippines/status/1949281087903121734?s=46&t=ja7TXFYUiFAOBQgFcAmRuw),
and who can blame him? They rule. I’ve long been deeply pro-pony. [Horses
should be able to do what they
want.](https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/11/year-in-review/horses-in-2018-the-
rider-lean-on-pete-sorry-to-bother-you) They are cool and good-looking and
better than human beings. They have manes. We don’t have manes. They have
twice our number of legs, and they _also_ get to have tails.

[Sometimes](https://youtu.be/vLRfj7ZZRpw?si=zGYfwiivATGgYWX8) they thunder
through lagoons and chase flamingos away.
[Sometimes](https://youtu.be/XbzKJ18VUUk?si=O7f-66K7hQtwIinF) they battle to
keep their harem.
[Sometimes](https://youtu.be/p1V1teWUXZs?si=3f1w5OJjCg15x1_m) they have
business across the river.
[Sometimes](https://youtu.be/JZQ6nTeDWv8?si=fZPDWPiD0ckaAK_K) they fart so
hard they scare children. Compared with the horse, we are nothing. No other
animal can unfurl something this majestic, this serene. We are not worthy.

Who else is giving you fireworks like that? It’s like Wilson Pickett
[said](https://youtu.be/TdRH-iUhH6E?si=78NupWUUxz0m424_): “Got to know how to
pony like Bony Maronie.” Tip of the Resistol to Hidalgo and
[Journalism](https://sports.yahoo.com/article/did-kentucky-derby-horse-
journalism-211312700.html), [Bamboo
Harvester](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_Harvester) and that nice
horse from _101 Dalmatians_ ,__ the steady gray steed __ who kicked Horace and
Jasper face-first through barn walls. Round of applause also for Disney Wiki,
which reminded me his name was
[Captain](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_\(101_Dalmatians\)). The
webpage lists his likes and dislikes. The Captain likes: the puppies being
safe. The Captain dislikes: the puppies in danger. That’s a stand-up horse
right there. Salt of heaven. A protector, a leader, a sweetheart, a friend. A
steed you can count on. A horse for all time.

Nikola Jokic](https://wp.theringer.com/2023/04/19/nba/nikola-jokic-denver-

By [Michael Pina](https://wp.theringer.com/creator/michael-pina/)

As many have noted, Jokic was more emotional about Demon’s W than he was [when
the Nuggets won the title](https://www.theringer.com/2023/06/12/nba/2023-nba-
champions-denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic-finals-mvp), and his postrace
celebration made the rounds on all the sports shows, a joyful moment pumped
into the soul grinder that is the content machine. Side-by-side clips emerged
of Jokic in the immediate aftermath of his 2023 NBA championship and his
reaction at Duzijanac. For some reason, this cannot be just a fun side
adventure. It cannot be _oh, that’s cool._ The event must be shoveled into the
discourse trough and become a referendum on whether it’s OK for a professional
athlete to care about something that isn’t their sport. [_Hikes up pants._] Do
they love this more than the game they’re paid millions to play? Grumble,
grumble, grumble, cry, cry, cry.

_When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he’s being surrounded by_ _  
__horses, horses, horses, horses_ _  
__coming in all directions_ _  
__white shining silver studs with their nose in flames_ _  
__He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses_

Anybody compelled to make an “I want my superstars at the gym, not the track”
argument should consider that it’s healthy to have interests outside of work.
What does it mean if he was more emotional after this race than he was after
his title? Who gives a shit? It’s all right to just enjoy the moment without
letting it change your perception of who he is as a basketball player, a
competitor, a person. It’s all right for it just to be something cool that
happened, a time a player let his hair down and showed more of himself. End of
