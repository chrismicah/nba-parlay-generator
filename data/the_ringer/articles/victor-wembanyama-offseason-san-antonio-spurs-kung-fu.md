# Victor Wembanyama’s Very Fascinating No-Basketball Summer

Chess in France. Soccer in Costa Rica. Kung fu in China. Perhaps we’ll
remember this offseason as the Summer of Wemby, in which the NBA’s most
mesmerizing talent leveled up by doing everything except play basketball.

There are countless clips of the Shaolin kung fu master Shi Dejian practicing
his
[_taolu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts#Forms_\(taolu\))
__ on the verge of oblivion. Standing on a gable roof or a ledge barely wider
than a narrow stance, the master flows through intricate, wavelike movements
at the cliff’s edge of Mount Song in the Henan province of China, without any
safeguards against what would be a plunge to certain death. He does so, often,
with a smile. “Kung fu is not only training the body,” [he once
said](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/shaolin-kung-fu).
“It is also about controlling fear.”

One must imagine Victor Wembanyama would be drawn to such an act—the audacity
to perform it could be derived only from a profound measure of discipline.
Wembanyama, of course, made headlines earlier this summer for [entering the
chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_36th_Chamber_of_Shaolin): a 10-day
retreat training body and mind at the Shaolin Monastery, where he earned an
entry-level rank in the Shaolin kung fu system (which, given his outsize
proportions and the limited time he spent at the temple, is arguably one of
the most impressive physical feats he’s ever accomplished).

“We were initiated there to the life of a warrior monk, which combines
Buddhism and intensive kung fu practice,” Wembanyama told the French newspaper
_L’Équipe_. “It was very hard. We discovered movements that we had never done
in our lives. It was more than 1,000 kicks to do per day, jumps, balance
exercises, stretching. We used muscles that we rarely used and which were
quickly overloaded. I had some of the biggest aches and pains of my life.”

 _Kung fu is not only training the body. It is also about controlling fear_.
Wembanyama looked out from the edge of his own personal oblivion back in
February, when he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right
shoulder, ending what had been an astonishing sophomore season. “I was afraid
of not being able to play basketball anymore,” Wembanyama admitted earlier
this month. “I think that we all have thoughts sometimes, irrational thoughts
about the things we care about most. But this type of thinking also changes
you as a person, for the better.”

Having caught a brief glimpse of his basketball mortality, Wembanyama has done
what any other 21-year-old with means would do: He’s gone globe-trotting.
Wemby has boasted an enviable itinerary since his season-ending diagnosis:
playing soccer with kids in Costa Rica, [practically
reenacting](https://x.com/tongbingxue/status/1936945920723374193?t=DopnVouEfkNg2a-rzp5Lpg&s=19)
[_Game of Death_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT-RfY2H23o) __ at the
Shaolin Monastery, [drilling a free
kick](https://x.com/MousaQi/status/1939796081241460792) and hitting the
_SIUUU_(and subsequently enjoying himself [at a
nightclub](https://x.com/Naija_PR/status/1941814129607786935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1941814129607786935%7Ctwgr%5E12a4aaa3cb1a4e5a13ac38fe3c4c05ede6ee7107%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fnba%2Fsan-

nightclub)) in Tokyo, and hosting the inaugural [“Hoop
Gambit”](https://www.chess.com/news/view/nba-superstar-wemby-organizes-chess-
tournament-in-france) tournament in his hometown of Le Chesnay just west of
Paris, which housed a chess competition and one-on-one and three-on-three
basketball games on courts that he helped create and design for the community.
All this amid one of the most pivotal summers in Spurs franchise history—one
that has forced San Antonio to interrogate its position in the league
hierarchy, knowing just how good Wemby is and can be. There’s a sense that
both parties have found clarity in the process.

Earlier this month, both Wemby and the Spurs confirmed that he’s been
medically cleared to play basketball again after five months of recovery. San
Antonio will be the biggest wild card of the 2025-26 NBA season, with a
ceiling that will be defined by what Wembanyama’s next leap looks like.
Perhaps we’ll look back and immortalize this strange period as the Summer of
Wemby, in which basketball’s final frontiersman leveled up by doing everything
_except_ playing basketball.

The locales were a bit more far-flung this summer, but Wemby has always taken
an interdisciplinary approach to offseason training. A [_Men’s Health_ story
from March](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a63917192/victor-wembanyama-
training/) detailed the unconventional speed drills Wemby put himself through
in the summer after his rookie year, as he found ways to simultaneously
prepare for an intense physical and mental load. Wembanyama’s high-intensity
interval training would start with cardio on an exercise bike, VersaClimber,
or underwater treadmill, which would immediately be followed by a minute-long
round of lightning chess with whatever Spurs employee was around. Then back to
cardio, then back to chess. A 30-minute workout would include six rounds of
play. (Longtime Toronto Raptors TV analyst Jack Armstrong has, over the years,
taken to describing the game of basketball as “ _turbo chess._ ” __ In Wemby,
he’s found his avatar.)

“If you can transition from, say, playing chess to training your body at a
high level on a cardio burst, that makes basketball so much easier, and it
makes the game so much slower to you,” trainer Melvin Sanders told _Men’s
Health._ Consider it an analog version of the [virtual reality
simulations](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5848480/2024/10/18/jayden-
daniels-virtual-reality-simulator-commanders/) that 2024 NFL Offensive Rookie
of the Year Jayden Daniels credits for his high-level processing on the field.

“There’s definitely growing research that says variability of practice,
getting different exposure to different types of play, is important,” Rob
Gray, a sports scientist for the Chicago Cubs and Arizona State University
professor of human systems engineering, told me in 2021. “Those kinds of
conditions make you more adaptable and a good problem solver instead of just
executing one play all the time.

“I think that’s part of what makes great players look like they’re a couple
seconds ahead of everybody. They’re picking up something a little bit before
it actually evolves,” Gray continued. “They’re seeing the movement, picking up
some cue or pattern. The same way a great chess master can see what you’re
trying to execute well before it’s unfolded. There’s so little time in these
sports for you to wait for things to be obvious. If you wait, it’s too late.”

Wembanyama hasn’t played actual basketball in nearly half a year, but he’s
trained his body in novel ways, exploring his range of motion and physical
endurance, gathering more data on the constraints of his titanic frame. He’s
also had plenty of time to imagine himself back on the court, to envision the
kind of player he hopes to become. He is already close to self-actualization
on defense, or at least is nearing the outer limits of how defensive impact
can be quantified. Only Manute Bol and Wembanyama have recorded multiple
seasons with at least 1,500 minutes played and at least a 10 percent block
rate. Bol had three such seasons across a 10-year career; Wembanyama has two
in his first two seasons. Wemby warps an augmented reality on defense by
virtue of his fluidity, timing, spatial awareness, and physical dimensions.
That much has been apparent from the second he stepped foot on an NBA court.

But when I think about what’s left to explore and refine on offense, my mind
drifts to a late-January game against the Clippers. (The Spurs lost, but
that’s beside the point.) His first basket came off what would typically be
considered a terrible lob pass from Devin Vassell that only Wembanyama could
reach—and even then, only barely, requiring full extension. Thus, it was a
perfect pass; just as Wemby is grasping his affordances on the court, so, too,
are his teammates in their supporting roles.

Mostly, though, I think about the six 3s Wembanyama attempted in that game,
half of them from at least 28 feet out. At this stage of his journey, Wemby is
still flirting with the unprecedented promise of his game; he’s still toying
with conventional wisdoms. Defenses aren’t meant to expect a 7-foot-3 center
to bring the ball up the court after a rebound, at full speed, before pulling
up for a deep 3; they shouldn’t need to anticipate a player that size being
able to seamlessly transfer his energy with the side of his foot à la Shai
Gilgeous-Alexander and then drill a stepback triple. Wemby hit three 3s that
game, each one in transition: a pull-up, a stepback, a trailer. Next season,
playing alongside three penetrative ball handlers in De’Aaron Fox, Stephon
Castle, and Dylan Harper—each with their own signature of speed, strength, and
guile, respectively—Wembanyama ought to have plentiful opportunities as a
trailer. That’s terrifying.

Last season, Wembanyama hit 42.2 percent of his 3-pointers in transition,
according to Synergy Sports—his third-most common play type that resulted in a
3, behind spot-ups and popping in a pick-and-roll. It’s a shot that will
always be available to him, and it will more often than not be wide open. What
can be done at the point of attack against a center with an 8-foot wingspan
comfortably pulling up from 30 feet out? How do you confront that kind of
anomaly when decades of positional orthodoxy are embedded in one’s muscle
memory? “By forcing defenses to acknowledge the potency of every inch of the
floor, you take control of your opponent,” I wrote nearly a decade ago in the
inaugural story published on _The Ringer_ , [examining the influence of Steph
Curry](https://www.theringer.com/2016/06/01/nba/steph-curry-ball-brothers-
chino-hills-c4a7719b22e9) through the lens of the Ball family _._ “The NBA had
to learn how to prevent shots that, before, never had to be guarded in the
first place.” It’s happening again.

Wemby consistently takes the long view, and it’s emboldened the Spurs
organization to follow suit. NBA history proves that there are only so many
chances a franchise gets to build around a defining talent—and even the best-
laid plans often go awry. The noise of pairing Wembanyama with the likes of
Giannis Antetokounmpo or Kevin Durant faded as quickly as it emerged. The
league and its followers have become conditioned to think in terms of closing
windows and ticking clocks, but there is an almost unnerving sense of calm and
foresight from Wembanyama. He’s in no hurry; he’s got his own sense of time.

Even with full basketball clearance, he has opted against participating in
next month’s FIBA EuroBasket 2025 in favor of working his way back into
basketball shape gradually. “I have to continue specific work on my shoulder
and especially get back into everything related to my basketball habits,”
Wembanyama said. “It’s been five months since I’ve played a five-on-five
match. If I had to have a game tomorrow, it would be risky. There are plenty
of reflexes to find, both conscious and linked to muscle memory.”

Though he’s still just 21 years old, Wembanyama has earned a measure of
goodwill rarely bestowed; there is faith in his unorthodoxy, trust in the
holistic sensibility of his training. This has been a moment in time to
understand and appreciate elite performance in sports as a practice divorced
from monomaniacal focus. Scottie Scheffler’s historic heater on the green
feels like the by-product of a sort of [existential
liberation](https://www.theringer.com/2025/07/20/golf/scottie-scheffler-wins-
open-championship-royal-portrush); Wembanyama’s generational potential is
augmented—perhaps even validated—by his insatiable curiosity. If basketball is
a complex expression of both the self and the union of many, then it stands to
benefit from external stimuli. Wemby’s retreat to the Shaolin Monastery could
simply have been a once-in-a-lifetime summer adventure, but given what we know
about how Wembanyama situates himself in the universe, it’s likely there was a
deeper intention at play.

In an episode of the 2008 BBC documentary series _Extreme Pilgrim_ , we see
master Shi Dejian demonstrating his patented death-defying wushu along the
cliffside roof, but not before [mopping his altar
space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QZO6BpJGgg) with the same flow and
economy of motion that he uses in his kung fu. The movements are the same; the
practice is the same. Kung fu is fighting; it’s also mopping, pouring tea, and
executing calligraphy. It’s the kind of embodied practice that might serve as
an organizing principle in Wemby’s grand unified theory—one where chess,
fantasy novels, martial arts, and basketball all convey tonal variations of
the same base language.

One imagines Wembanyama feeling a sense of kinship with the Shaolin master.
Shi Dejian, too, was once a 19-year-old prodigy who left home in search of the
ultimate refinement; he found it in those Songshan Mountains over the past
four-plus decades, just like Wemby is finding his own path along the San
Antonio River. End of article
