2) Sam LaPorta - Injured in camp so likely ramping up to full strength. Has the most routes ran of any TE in the league & his 10% targets-per-route-ran rate is a huge drop from his 24% rate last year, which will certainly return to normal.

3) Chris Olave - We likely aren‚Äôt going to continue to see 4 TD games for Alvin Kamara & eventually Olave will outproduce Rashid Shaheed. So far their new offensive scheme & playcaller have lead to the best offense in football through two weeks.
