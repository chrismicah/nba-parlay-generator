    return self.qdrant.search(
        collection_name=f"sports_knowledge_base_{sport.lower()}",
        query_vector=query_vector,
        query_filter=models.Filter(
            must=[models.FieldCondition(
                key="sport", 
                match=models.MatchValue(value=sport.upper())
            )]
