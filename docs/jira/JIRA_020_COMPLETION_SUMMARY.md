# JIRA-020 COMPLETION SUMMARY: Few-Shot Learning Enhancement

## Overview
Successfully implemented few-shot learning capabilities for the ParlayStrategistAgent to improve parlay prompting using high-confidence past examples. This enhancement uses historical successful parlays to guide new parlay generation and improve recommendation quality.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Task 1: Analyze Current Structure
- **File**: `tools/parlay_strategist_agent.py`
- **Analysis**: Examined existing ParlayStrategistAgent and BetsLogger
- **Findings**: 
  - Current agent generates reasoning with basic patterns
  - Historical data stored in SQLite database (`data/parlays.sqlite`)
  - Existing parlay reasoning dataset with 1000 samples available
  - Demo database contains sample successful/failed parlays

### ✅ Task 2: Identify Successful Parlays
- **File**: `tools/few_shot_parlay_extractor.py`
- **Implementation**: Created comprehensive extraction system
- **Success Criteria**:
  - High-confidence winning parlays (367 found from 1000 samples)
  - Success scoring algorithm considering:
    - Odds range (2.0-8.0 optimal)
    - Leg count (2-4 optimal)
    - Reasoning quality indicators
    - Pattern recognition factors
- **Results**: Extracted top 10 examples with success scores 2.19-2.23

### ✅ Task 3: Convert to Few-Shot Format
- **Files**: 
  - `tools/few_shot_parlay_extractor.py`
  - `data/few_shot_parlay_examples.json`
- **Format Created**:
  ```json
  {
    "example_id": "few_shot_01",
    "input_data": {
      "available_games": [...],
      "injury_intel": [...],
      "line_movements": [...],
      "statistical_insights": [...]
    },
    "reasoning": "PARLAY ANALYSIS...",
    "outcome": "win",
    "confidence_score": 0.8,
    "success_metrics": {...}
  }
  ```
- **Prompt Template**: Generated structured template for agent integration

### ✅ Task 4: Integrate into ParlayStrategistAgent
- **File**: `tools/enhanced_parlay_strategist_agent.py`
- **New Class**: `FewShotEnhancedParlayStrategistAgent`
- **Key Features**:
  - Loads few-shot examples from JSON file
  - Pattern matching against successful examples
  - Enhanced confidence scoring based on historical patterns
  - Improved reasoning generation with few-shot insights
  - Dynamic prompt enhancement with successful example patterns

#### Few-Shot Enhancement Process:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar patterns in current games vs successful examples
2. **Insight Extraction**: Extracts relevant insights from successful examples
3. **Confidence Boosting**: Adjusts confidence based on pattern matching
4. **Reasoning Enhancement**: Adds few-shot insights to generated reasoning
5. **EV Adjustment**: Modifies expected value based on historical performance

### ✅ Task 5: Comprehensive Testing
- **File**: `tests/test_jira_020_few_shot_learning.py`
- **Test Coverage**:
  - **Unit Tests**: 14 comprehensive test cases
  - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
  - **Performance Tests**: Comparison between regular and enhanced agents
  - **Extractor Tests**: Few-shot example extraction and formatting
  - **Agent Tests**: Enhanced reasoning and pattern matching

#### Test Results:
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FewShotParlayExtractor**
   - Analyzes historical parlay dataset
   - Calculates success scores for ranking
   - Extracts structured input data and parlay patterns
   - Generates prompt templates for agent integration

2. **FewShotEnhancedParlayStrategistAgent**
   - Extends original ParlayStrategistAgent
   - Loads and manages few-shot examples
   - Pattern matching and similarity scoring
   - Enhanced reasoning generation with historical insights

3. **FewShotContext**
   - Manages few-shot examples and metadata
   - Provides prompt templates and statistics
   - Enables pattern matching capabilities

### Key Algorithms

#### Success Score Calculation
```python
def _calculate_success_score(parlay):
    score = 1.0  # Base for winning
    
    # Odds optimization (2.0-8.0 sweet spot)
    if 2.0 <= odds <= 8.0:
        score += min(0.5, (odds - 2.0) / 12.0)
    
    # Leg count optimization (2-4 optimal)
    if 2 <= legs <= 4:
        score += 0.3
    
    # Pattern bonuses
    if 'sharp money' in reasoning:
        score += 0.2
    if 'statistical edge' in reasoning:
        score += 0.2
    
    return score
```

#### Pattern Matching
```python
def _calculate_pattern_matching_score(opportunities):
    score = 0.0
    for opp in opportunities:
        for insight in opp['few_shot_insights']:
            score += insight['confidence_boost'] * 2
    
    return min(1.0, score / total_factors)
```

    target_legs=3,
    use_few_shot=True
)

# Enhanced reasoning includes few-shot insights
print(recommendation.reasoning.reasoning_text)
```

### Extract Few-Shot Examples
